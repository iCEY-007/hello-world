# About me
## Hobbies
### Video Games
Here's just a list of my favourite games in no particular order
- Titanfall 2
- TLoU
- Dark Souls 3
- Bloodborne
- Elden Ring (for now since I'm not done with it yet)
- God of War (~~Don't kill me for this but I haven't had the chance to play the original series yet so this is the remake~~)
- Doom (2016)
- The Witness
- Apex Legends
- XCOM
- Fo:NV
- Celeste

Honestly, I play way too many games to keep count and I play more indie games than this, I just don't have the time to list them all :p 

### Reading
Not gonna do a list this time, I haven't read much (although I might update this gradually as I read more who knows), but I'm currently reading Caraval by Stephanie Garber and my favourite book is Foundation by Isaac Asimov (for now)

### Movies and TV shows
Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds are good, but have you ever heard of ***Breaking Bad*** >:3

also, Death Note is kinda bad but I love it. Speaking of anime, FMA:B is good and Horimiya is my comfort show.
